Jenn: a collection of symmetric go boards in projective 3-space

Files:
jenn.exe
glut32.dll (needs to be in same directory)

System requirements:
a pretty good 3d graphics card

Mouse buttons:
left on empty vertex plays black stone
right on empty vertex plays white stone
either button on played vertex removes stone

left-dragging off of vertex rotates projection
right-dragging off of vertex translates projection

Colors:
Solid black or white line connects within a group (black-black or white-white edge)
Blue line denotes a liberty (black-empty or white-empty edge)
Red line denotes an attack (blck-white edge)

Command line: (my counting may be wrong)
for the hardy, the first 6 arguments are the off-diagnol elements of the
cartan matrix generating the reflection group of  the graph.  further arguments
mod the group out by some subset of the generators as forming a vertex-
invariant subgroup.

>jenn
  (defaults as >jenn 2 2 3 5 2 3 0 2 3)
  a 300-pt go board
>jenn 3 3 3 2 2 2
  a 96-pt go board
>jenn 3 3 3 2 2 2 1
  a 48-pt go board
>jenn 3 3 3 2 2 2 0
  a 44-pt go board
>jenn (2n) 2 2 2 2 (2n) 1 2
  where (2n) is any even number: a 2*n^2 klein-patch go board
>jenn 5 3 2 2 2 2
  a 120-pt go board
>jenn 2 2 3 5 2 3 0 3
  a 1200-pt beauty, my favorite
